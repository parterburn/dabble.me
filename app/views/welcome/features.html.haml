        %strong Dabble Me was built in a way to help you actually keep a journal.
      %p It sends you an email every day asking how your day went. Hit reply and start typing anything. You can also attach up to 5 photos per email that will remind you of your day. When you're done, hit send, and your entry will be saved instantly.
      %p With every reminder email, we'll include one of your previous entries chosen at random. You might get one from yesterday, last week, or last year.
