            %strong Daily Dabble
            — reflections from your day is the most popular use case of any journal. This can be a scary one to get started with. If self-reflection is overwhelming to even think about, keep reading.
          %li
            %strong Memory keeper for major events/milestones
            — we easily forget. Write it down now and the daily emails will bring you smiles when it reminds you of all your favorite moments. I started journaling when I first met my wife 5 years ago — I took 5 minutes to write about all of the dates we went on. Reading those past entries to each other has become a routine that deepens our relationship now.
          %li
            %strong Goals/Health Tracking
            — use #hashtags in your posts for easily tagging entries with your different goals or visits to different doctors.
          %li
            %strong Learning Aid
            — especially for learning to code or different college courses. The concept of past entries in your inbox is a way of reminding you what you learned that day. It makes the subject matter much more sticky so you actually remember it.
          %li
            %strong Baby’s Firsts
            — use it to track the progress of your children. Pictures go great with this one. Jot down notes and add photos so you can easily put together a scrapbook later.
